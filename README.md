# Personal Blog

> I moved to a 3rd party solution called Hashnode, because I don't have time to maintain my own solution.

This is my NextJS + Tailwind CSS + Supabase Blog project, with the objective of being my first 100% complete website.

The Supabase schema will be available some time in the future.
